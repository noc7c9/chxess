# Chxess

Implementation of chess in the Haxe language. Specificially targeting
javascript, both browsers and Node.js.

Building the library requires only Haxe. Build using `haxe build.hxml` or `npm
run build`.

Node.js is required only for the unit tests (via
[AVA](https://github.com/avajs/ava)). Run tests using `npm test`.

Re-running tests on changes can be done via `npm run test:watch`.
